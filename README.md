Master thesis in Koopman operator theory for the master in Scientific Computing at TU Berlin

The title of this thesis is "Approximation of Koopman Operators using randomly chosen basis functions"

The main contribution in this work is the the use of random Gaussians as basis functions combined with Extended dynamic mode decomposition method (EDMD),
that lead to a good approximation of the Koopman eigenfunctions. Also, the use of randomly initialised neural networks as a basis functions.
